// I didn't remember that we had already overloaded the comparator function way back in Part 2 .. The below code worked just fine, but obviously reusing the previously written code makes more sense. Thanks forum!
//return inventory.sort { $0.rarity.rawValue < $1.rarity.rawValue || ($0.rarity.rawValue == $1.rarity.rawValue && $0.baseValue < $1.baseValue) }
