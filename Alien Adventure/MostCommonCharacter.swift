    //This code was written by Udacity forum user robertozanchi. Intitially I wanted to sort the dictionary by value, but that isn't possible with a Swift dictionary. I was able to find a sort method for using with NSDictionaries, but a dictionary of type [Character:Int] cannot be converted to an NSDictionary by coercion.
